# Java_Algorithms
Demonstrating a variety of common algorithms for strings, numbers & arrays. 

This project demonstrates multiple solutions for any particular problem.

This is an ongoing project but here's whats covered so far ...

####STRINGS
* Locating duplicate characters
* Whitespace removal
* String reversal
* Anagrams

---

####NUMBERS
* Determining Armstrong numbers
* Odd / Even Numbers (using binary & modulus)
* Number pyramids

---

####ARRAYS
* Array equality
* Duplicate elements
* Array reversal
* Number Arrays - Avg, Min, Max, Frequency, Next Max

---

####MATRIXES
* Creation
* Calculations (adding, subtracting, etc..)
* Manipulation
* Transposing
